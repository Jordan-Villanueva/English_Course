- `sentence-tokenizer`: works for sentence splitting, but cannot recognize example sentences.  
- `sentence-splitter`: fails at splitting correctly (breaks sentences inside quotes with `?` or `!`), but can recognize example sentences.  

üîó https://github.com/Tessmore/sbd  
- Cannot recognize:  
  `Mr.James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst.`  
- Splits at `Mr.James` incorrectly.  

`wink-nlp`  
- `'What a day!' I thought. 'What are you doing?' she asked.`  
- Gets split into wrong sentences.  

`compromise`  
- Performs well, also includes built-in word segmentation.  

üëâ All of the above libraries split:  
`'Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!'`  
into **two sentences**...
