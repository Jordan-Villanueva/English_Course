abacus），它是一种带槽的金属算盘，槽中放着石子，上下移动石子进行计算。据记载，在公元前15世纪，古罗马的工程师Vitruvius 还发明了一种利用石子来计算距离的仪器。这种仪器安装在车轮上，车轮每转动一次，就有一粒石子落到一个容器里。通过数容器里的石子就可以算出车轮驶过的距离。拉丁语calculus表示鹅卵石或小石子。由于石子在算术中的广泛应用，calculus一词进入英语后，除了表示“结石”外，还可以表示“微积分”。英语单词calculate（计算）则源自拉丁文calculatus，后来表示使用石子计数的做法。英语单词calcium（钙）的也与calculus有关，因为石头的主要成分就是钙。\n

restore）的名词形式，字面意思就是“能restore（恢复）人体力（的东西）”。与restaurant有关的一个英语单词是restore，它与法语restaurer同源，都来自法语restorer、拉丁语restaurare。\n 刚开始时，Boulanger还仅仅是提供这种叫做restaurant的肉汤。后来，他的生意越做越大，提供的食物越来越多，人们开始直接来他的店里享用他提供的食物，就像现代人下馆子一样。这就与上门提供膳食服务的caterer产生了竞争。为此，caterer的行业公会与Boulanger打起了官司，但Boulanger出乎意料地赢了官司。这样，越来越多的人来Boulanger的店里就餐，也有越来越多的人仿效Boulanger的做法，开店提供饮食服务。很多的caterer也受雇于这种店铺，变成了chef（厨师）。\n  由于Boulanger的店最初是以restaurant（肉汤）出名的，所以人们就管这种提供饮食服务的店称为restaurant。\n restaurant：['restrɒnt] n.餐馆，饭店\n caterer：['keɪtərə] n.备办食物者，承办酒席者\n chef：[ʃef] n.厨师，主厨，大厨"},{"t":"restaurant:餐馆","d":"来自法语

 这种海螺在腓尼基的浅海非常多，人们便用熬出的染料来染布。由于这种紫红色的布在地中海沿岸许多国家大受欢迎，供不应求，许多腓尼基人靠贩卖染料、布匹发了财。于是他们渐渐放弃了农业生产，以经商为生。在当时，腓尼基商人的足迹遍及地中海南北各个海港。\n  英语单词purple来自希腊语porphyra，原本指的是腓尼基人所生产的这种紫色染料，后来逐渐演变为表示“紫色”这种颜色。\n

 古希腊人也会使用天平，并最早创造了衡器理论。古希腊科学家亚里士多德、欧几里德和阿基米德都曾经研究过等臂杠杆的平衡、稳定性以及天平灵敏度与臂长的关系。古希腊人所使用的天平与古埃及天平类似，也是由两个秤盘构成。\n  到了古罗马时期，出现了杆秤，即只使用一个秤盘和一个秤砣，通过秤砣在秤梁上的位置来确定秤盘上的货物的重量。与需要两个秤盘和多个不同刻度的砝码的天平相比，杆秤无疑更加先进。\n  英语单词balance最初的本意是“天平”。它源自古拉丁语bilanx，由bi（two，两个）+lanx（pans，盘）构成，指的就是“由两个秤盘构成的天平”。后来，该词又逐渐衍生出“平衡”的比喻之意，再在财会领域中，由“财务平衡表的差值”而衍生出“余额”之意。\n balance： ['bæl(ə)ns]

of）+cappa（cape，斗篷）构成，字面意思就是“脱掉斗篷”。因此，英语单词escape可以按以下方式记忆其拼写：escape=es（=ex，out of，脱掉）+cape（斗篷）。\n escape：[ɪ'skeɪp; e-] n.逃跑，逃亡vt.逃避，避开，避免vi.逃脱，溜走"},{"t":"escape:逃跑","d":"来自拉丁语*excappare, 逃跑，ex-,

administration（城市管理）。该词来自拉丁语politia（城市管理）和希腊语polis（城市）。英语词根polis就来源于此。早在13世纪，法国就出现了专门维持社会治安的武装力量。1254年，路易九世创立“夜间巡警队”。1337年，腓力六世创立“法国骑兵团”，后来改名为“宪兵骑警队”。但是这些武装力量都还没有以police命名。1667年，法国国王路易十四创立了“警察副总监”官职，首次用police一词来表示当时负责维持社会治安的武装力量。从此以后，单词police才含有了“警察”的含义。\n1828年，在当时的英国内政大臣Robert Peel爵士的主持下，英国通过“大都市警察法案”（Metropolitan police act），率先建立了现代警察制度。第二年，他组建了伦敦警察部队。从此以后，表示“警察”的police一词开始在英国广为使用。\nmetropolis： [mɪ'trɒp(ə)lɪs] n.大都市，首府，重要中心。记：metro=matri，母亲+polis城市→母城→大城市，首府\nmetropolitan： [metrə'pɒlɪt(ə)n] adj.大城市的，首府的n.大城市人，宗主国的公民\ncosmopolis：[kɒz'mɒp(ə)lɪs] n.国际都市。记：cosmo=cosmos，宇宙的，世界的+polis城市→世界性的城市→国际都市\npolice：[pə'liːs] n.警察，警方，治安adj.警察的vt.管辖，维持……的治安"},{"t":"police:警察","d":"关于这一常用词的身世，令天恐怕很少人会去探究。它源出希腊语poiis（城市），通过拉丁词politia（政策，政府）和中古法语词police于16世纪进入英语。最初词的重音落在第一个音节上，原始词义为“国家政策”(staie policy)。1750年左右，法国建立_第一支现代化的警察部队，这时police已含有“执法”(law enforcement)之意。其实这可以说足吐界上最早的警察部队，也是当代各国警察部队的原型。1828年英国通过有争议的“大都市治安洼”(Metropolitan policc act)，提出该治安法的主要是英国内政大臣Robert Peel爵士(1788 - 1850)。翌年，他组建了伦敦警察部队。从此以后，police 一词转义为“警察”，并开始在莫国广为使用。Robert的昵称是Bobby，因此英国人至今在口语中仍然爱用bobby 一词作为警察的代称。英国英语中还有一个表示“警察”的俚语用词peeler则是出自这位内政大臣的姓氏，peel加表人后缀-er构成的。早在1818年Robert Peel任爱尔兰首席秘书时，就在那里建立了一支爱尔兰保安队(the IrishConstabuluy)，队员被称为peeler。待到1829年伦敦警察部队组建起来以后，peeler在俚语中也被用以泛指“警察”了，但如今州得很少。至于原义为“马厩总管”的constable 一词恐怕也是在1829年以后才被赋予“警察”这一新义的。可见，英国英语中表示“警察”的policeman，bobby，peeler，constable四个阐同Robert Peel或多或少均有关系。"},{"t":"police:警察","d":"来自拉丁语politia,城市管理，来自希腊语polis,城市，词源同policy,polity.该词为policy对词，后用于指警察。"}]},{"id":12080,"word":"every second

Blanket的人于1320首先使用了这种布料来制作毛毯。Thomas Blanket是一名毛纺品制造商。在一个寒冷的冬夜，Blanket家的木柴恰好用完了，家里冷得像冰窖一样。于是，Blanket把从工厂带回家的一些白色呢绒铺在床上，意外发现这种呢绒的保暖效果特别好。于是，Blanket开始使用这种白色呢绒制作御寒用的毛毯，并在市场上取得了很好的销量。因为这个传说，有人认为blanket一词来自Thomas Blanket的姓氏。但据语言学家考证，单词blanket出现的时间比Thomas Blanket生活的时代更早，因此，更有可能是Thomas Blanket因为使用白色呢绒发明了毛毯而被人称为Blanket，毛毯得名于blanket这种原料而非他的姓氏。\n人们最初将用白色呢绒做成的毛毯称为blanket，后来，该词的含义逐渐泛化，可以表示用各种材质做成的毯子。\nblanket：['blæŋkɪt] n.毛毯，毯子vt.覆盖，掩盖，用毯子盖。记：blank白色的+et小的→带有细毛的白色呢绒→用白色呢绒做的毛毯→毛毯，毯子\nblank： [blæŋk] n.空白，空虚adj.空白的，空虚的v.（使）成为空白"},{"t":"blanket:毯子","d":"blank,

Daly创造的。一天，他和别人打赌说他可以在一夜之间造出一个新的、毫无意义的、却又不能为人们接受的词来。他花钱雇了一些顽童，连夜在都柏林城中的每一面墙壁上用粉笔写上“quiz”的字样。第二天一早，人们发现了这个词，但谁也不知道它的含义是什么，于是这个毫无词义的“quiz”不久就有了“智力测验”、“恶作剧”等词义。"},{"t":"quiz:测试，查问，盘问","d":"可能来自拉丁语qui

 早在中世纪时，足球运动的雏形——用脚踢球的比赛——就已经在英格兰出现。但直到这项运动在伊顿和拉格比等高级私立学校的贵族少年中流行后，人们才开始考虑制订统一的比赛规则。1863年10月的一个晚上，12家英格兰足球俱乐部的负责人在伦敦一家酒馆聚会，统一了足球运动的规则，并成立了英格兰足球协会。\n  然而，到了1871年，以拉格比（Rugby）学院为首的另一批足球俱乐部聚会，制订了另一种足球运动规则，更多地允许用手触球。为了区分这两种足球运动，人们将拉格比学院牵头制订规则的足球运动称为“拉格比足球”（其实就是英式橄榄球运动），简称为rugger；将英格兰足球协会制订规则的足球运动称为“协会足球”，简称为soccer，来自association（协会）一词。\n  美国人用football表示“橄榄球运动”，为了区分，便用soccer来表示“足球”。在英国，soccer和football原本都得到使用，但出于对美式英语的抵触，英国人现在几乎不使用soccer一词，而是用football来表示足球运动。\n soccer：['sɑkɚ]

Galen，130? - 2007）则认为发生在肿瘤部位周围的静脉扩张恰似蟹足，cancer因而得名。据此，cancer的词义又进一步延伸为“（会扩散遗害的）弊端”或“痼疾”。"},{"t":"cancer:癌症，恶性肿瘤；弊端","d":"来源于拉丁语cancer(螃蟹),17世纪前这一词汇被用来称呼血管壁附近形状类似螃蟹的肿瘤。"}]},{"id":13293,"word":"first-year

-再嘱咐她不要探究他的身分，也不许她窥看他的面容。日暮之后，他总是如约而来；日出之前，他便迅即离去。一天夜里，Psyche由于她的姐妹的唆使，加上自己的好奇心的驱使，在他熟睡之时，点上蜡烛偷看，方知和她相爱的人竟是众神中最俊美的爱神Cupid。她惊喜交集，手不禁颤抖了一下，一滴烛油落在他的肩上。Cupid顿时惊醒，旋即离去，从此不见，宫殿也随之消失。Psyche悔恨不已，悲恸欲绝。她四处漂游，寻觅情人，并沦为爱与美的女神Venus['vi:nəs] [罗神]维纳斯（即希腊神话中的Aphrodite）的奴隶。Venus是Cupid的母亲，对Psyche的美貌本来就十分嫉妒，她逼她干各种括儿，想方设法摧残折磨她。最后，Psyche历尽种种磨难，终于和Cupid重聚，结为夫妇，并成为灵魂、精神和生命之神。\n    追根溯源，psychology中的构词成分psycho实由Psyche演变而来。除了psychology，英语中还有不少词，诸如psychic（精神的，心理的），psychiatry（精神病学），psychoanalysis\n（精神分析），psychotic（精神病患者），psychosis（精神变态，精神病），psychopath（精神变态者），等等，均源出Psyche一词。"},{"t":"psychology:心理学，心理","d":"词根词缀：

ten（七十岁，古稀之年）这样的字句。17世纪时引申出了“理由”一义，才有了on that score（因那理由），on the score of（因为）等短语。score用于比赛表示“得分”，始于18世纪。英国牌戏专家霍伊尔（Edward Hoyle，1672 -

bruise（头部的伤痕）这样的字句，其中capital 一词即含此义。capital的几个常用词义均与“头”有联系。旧时一个人犯了capital crime（死罪）被判以capital sentence（死刑）或被处以capital punishment（极刑）不是被砍头就是被绞死。capital letter（大写字母）一般多位于句首和词首。capital还用以指“首都”、“首府”，该用法出自弥尔顿笔下，始见于《失乐园》。capital用以指“资本”则始于用牛的头数计算财富的时代，但这一用法直至18世纪才通用起来。除了capital，源自拉丁语caput的英语常用词还有cape（海角），captain（队长，船长），decapitate（斩首），chapter（章，回），precipice（悬崖），precipitate（头朝下的）等。"},{"t":"capital:首都，首府；资本，资金；大写字母","d":"词根词缀：

math（数学之后）的意思吗？当然不是。这里的math来自古英语，等于mow（割草）。该词的由来与牧草有关。\n在广阔的草原上，牧草拥有很强的再生能力，能在刈割或放牧后再次生长。游牧民族很早就发现了牧草的再生能力，并在放牧时加以充分利用，并将第一次刈割后的再生牧草称为aftermath，意思就是“after the first mowing”（经过初次刈割后），即“再生草、第二茬草”。后来，aftermath的词义逐渐扩充，除了牧草以外，还可以表示其他事物的第二波次，如地震的余波。后来词义继续扩大，用来表示某一事物带来的结果。由于第二茬牧草的质量往往不如头生的，所以aftermath往往表示不好的结果，中文中一般译为“后果”。\naftermath：['ɑːftəmæθ] n.后果，余波，再生草"},{"t":"aftermath:后果，余波","d":"after,在后。-math,割草，拟声词，同mow。原指割的第二遍草，即质量比较差的草，引申比喻义后果，余波。"},{"t":"aftermath:后果","d":"该词系由after和math复合而成。math在古英语中原作meath，意为mowing（割草，收割）；aftermath原义为after

plaudere（鼓掌、欢呼）构成。\n  在17世纪时，explode一词在英语中的意思是“通过暴力或突然的噪声将其赶出去”，与其本意差不多。到了18世纪后期，词义慢慢变为“使其突然而又大声地爆发”，后来才完全转变为“突然而又大声地爆发、爆炸”。\n explode：[ɪk'spləʊd; ek-]

exploded him off the stage这样的句子。explode的今义“（使）爆炸”始用于18世纪。在英国词典编纂家贝利（Nathan Bailey，？ - 1742）和约翰逊(SamueL Johnson，1709 - 1784)所编词典里尚未见explode这一词条注有此义。第一个被《牛津英语词典》引用的例子是美国政治家莫里斯(Gouverneur Morris，1752 -

（=Christmastime,圣诞节期），Eastertide（复活节周），Whitsuntide（=Whitsun,圣灵降临周）等，这些词或属诗歌语言，或为罕用书面语。tide的今义“潮水”始用于14世纪，是从“时间”一义引申的，这是因为潮涨潮落有定时的缘故。嗣后，tide又进而喻指“潮流”或“趋向”。\n  英语另一常用词tidy究其根源是从tide 一词派生的，由tide加后缀-y构成，故早在13世纪时是timely（及时的，适时的）的意思，直到18世纪才用以表示“整洁的”，“整齐的”，到了19世纪又被赋予“相当大的”或“相当好的”一义。"},{"t":"tide:时节，季节，潮汐，潮水","d":"来自古英语 tid,一段时间，时期，时节，来自 Proto-Germanic*tidiz,一段时间，来自 PIE*di-ti,

一词。它最初原作 tanque，始于1616年一段有关印度之行的报道：“Besides their rivers they have many ponds which they call tanques.”（除了河流之外，还有许多他们称之为tanque的池塘。）其实，在印度各种方言中与之相关的词均有“池塘”、“蓄水池”、“水库”等义。因此tank 进入英语之后，多指盛液体或气体的“罐”、“箱”、“柜”等容器，在印度英语和巴基斯坦英语中 tank至今仍保留上述原始词义。tank 在现代军事上意指“坦克”是偶然事件造成的。\n  第一次世界大战期间，英语在秘密制造第一批坦克时，为了暂保住这一秘密，在机密文件中使用了tank一词作为该新式武器的代称（code name），因为它形似苯罐（benzene tank）。据传，是丘吉尔（Sir Winston Churchill,1874-1965）在1915年最薄先这样使用的。在运往法国时，装坦克的板条箱也标上TANK 的字样，以免引起敌人耳目的注意。此一安全措施果然奏效，德国人误以为运往前线的只是water-tank（水罐车）。这批坦克被投用于1916年的索姆河战役（the Battle of the Somme）。然而这种新式武器却没有起到预期的作用，英法联军的进攻只是迫使德国人的战线往后推移了一些，而双方都付出了高昂的代价，这是现代战争史上首次使用这一武器。武器的主要发明者斯温顿爵士（Sir Ernest Swinton）建议以tank作为其正式改属名，该词便这样沿用了下来。汉语“坦克”是从英语音译过来的。"},{"t":"tank:水箱，壶，罐，坦克","d":"来自葡萄牙语 tanque,水箱，容器，借自印度语，如印度总理莫迪所在邦古吉拉特语 tankh, 水箱，畜水池，最终可能来自梵语 tadaga,池塘。现主要词义军事坦克来自一战时英国人发 明该重型装甲武器后为出其不意给德军重创，从而以”Tank”作掩护而得名。"},{"t":"tank:（坦克）：首台坦克研制期间的代号","d":"第一次世界大战期间，机枪之类的自动速射武器已经大量应用。战场上堑壕纵横，碉堡林立，由机枪构成的强大阵地防御火力体系对进攻方造成了强大的人员伤亡。1914年，英国远征军的随军记者斯文顿上校在战场上亲眼目睹了一排排英国士兵被德国机枪扫倒的惨状。回国后，他向英国国防部提交了研制具有强大防护能力的越野战车的建议。然而，当时的英国陆军大臣吉齐纳对此建议不感冒，反而是海军大臣温斯顿•丘吉尔对此表示支持，并成立委员会，开始这种新型战车的研制。为了保密，研发人员对工人谎称研制的是一种储水装置，并曾提出过cistern（水箱）、reservoir（蓄水池）等名称，但最终人们还是采用了发音响亮的tank（水槽）一词作为它的代号。从此以后，tank一词就成为了这种新型战车的正式名称，在中文中音译为“坦克”。\ntank：[tæŋk]

从单词ban衍生出形容词banal，原意是“与ban有关的”，如banal right指的就是领主所拥有的发布公告的权利。由于领地内所有人都必须遵守领主的公告，所以banal一词逐渐产生“公共的，普遍的”之意，进而产生“司马见惯的，陈腐的”的含义。\n 单词abandon（放弃）也与ban有关。它源自法语词组 à bandon（under control or jurisdiction），其中的à =at，bandon和ban一样源自拉丁语bannun，表示“控制、管辖”。 该词组常用于法律术语mettre a bandon（put something under someone else’s control），表示“放弃对某物的控制、放弃某些权利”，如Mettre sa forest à bandon意思就是放弃对森林的权利，其他人可以去森林狩猎、伐木。\n ban：[bæn]

drink a toast，其字面意思是“喝完一杯泡有烤面包的酒”，后来转义为“干杯”或“为……举怀祝酒”，甚至转指“受祝酒的人”、“受到高度敬仰的人”，如the toast of the town（城里最受敬仰的人）。"},{"t":"toast:烤面包片，祝酒，受祝酒的人","d":"toast 一词源自拉丁语 tostus （烤过的）。在英语中“烤面包（片）”作toast,“祝酒”也作 toast。这两者之间有无联系呢？旧时，在英国流行一种习俗：人们饮酒时，常爱把一块放有香料的烤面包片（a piece of spiced toast）加入酒中，据说这样可酒味更美。该习俗在莎士比亚时代尤为风行，所以我们今天有 to drink a toast 的说法。\n  据传，昔日英国人还认为受祝酒的人的名字，尤其是自己所爱慕女人的芳名，也会像烤面包片那样使酒变得芳香甜美。这种看法可能起源于爱尔兰散文作家、评论家、剧作家斯梯尔（Richard Steel,1672-1729）在他主办的单张小品期刊《闲谈者》（The Tatler）第24期（1709年6月4日）上发表的一篇轶闻趣事，内容大意如下：查理二世在位时，一位有名的美男妇人在巴思温泉（Bath）休养。有个追求她的人为了向她献殷勤，从她站着的温泉水中舀了一杯水，当众为她的健康干杯。他在旁的一个唱半醉的朋友说，他本人倒不喜欢那水，而是喜欢泡在其中的toast,也就是泡在水中的美人。从此以后，toast 一词既用以表示“祝酒”，也常引申为“受祝酒的人”。"},{"t":"toast:烤火，烤面包，面包，干杯，祝酒","d":"来自 古法 语 toster, 烤火 ， 烤 面包， -st, 过去 分词 格， 来 自拉 丁语 torrere, 燃烧 ， 词 源同 torrid,terracotta.拼写比较 roast,roster.后引申词义干杯，祝酒，致辞等，最初用于祝愿漂亮女

故事到此结束了。故事虽然美丽，但实际情况更可能是来自面包的比喻义，因这种面包当时 用于增加酒的香味，因此，举杯前说一段祝酒辞能更好的增加宴会的品味。"}]},{"id":35466,"word":"thunderstorm","phonetic0":"ˈθʌndəstɔːm","phonetic1":"ˈθʌndərstɔːrm","trans":[{"pos":"n.","cn":"雷雨，雷暴，雷雨交加"}],"sentences":[{"c":"She got caught

slave：[sleɪv] n.奴隶，从动装置vi.苦干，拼命工作\n slavery：['sleɪv(ə)rɪ] n.奴役，奴隶身份，奴隶制度"},{"t":"slave:奴隶","d":"从形式上看，slave一词同另一个词Slav颇为相似，实际一上slave也正是源于Slav的。\n　　Slav即“斯拉夫人”，原指一度居住于北乌克兰，即第聂伯河岸的一个部落，今指包括俄罗斯人、乌克兰人、保加利亚人、塞尔维亚人、克罗地亚人、捷克人、波兰人等在内的一个民族统称。Slav在原民族里有“高贵的”之意。Czechoslovakia（捷克斯洛伐克）的两大民族之一叫做Slovaks（斯洛伐克人），而Yugoslavia（南斯拉夫）的主要民族之一叫做Slovenes（斯洛文尼亚人）。Czechoslovakia这一国名的意思是land of the Czechs and Slovaks，而Yugoslavia这一国名的意思则是land of the South Slavs。这些都与Slav这一名称有些渊源关系。\n　　在中世纪早期斯拉夫人向西扩张，征服了欧洲一些地区。但到了公元6世纪左右他们反倒被来自西面的日耳曼部落所征服，许多人被贩卖到中欧和西欧，沦为罗马人的奴隶。罗马人把他们叫做Sclavus，意思是“斯拉夫俘虏”，后来转指“奴隶”。该词在法语里作esclave，13世纪进入英语时作sclave，约到16世纪时其中的字母c脱落了，变成slave这一形式，仍然泛指“奴隶”。因此我们可以说slave是从一个专有名词逐渐衍变而为普通名词的。德语对应词Sklave和西班牙语对应词esclavo等亦源于此。"},{"t":"slave:奴隶，贩卖奴隶","d":"来自拉丁语

vale，等于英语中的“flesh, farewell!”（肉，再见！），所以其本意应译为“谢肉节”。根据基督教的教义，基督复活节前40天是封斋节。封斋节期间禁止食肉和娱乐。因此，在封斋节开始前三天，人们便抓紧时间开始纵情吃喝玩乐。一些主张宗教改革的人如新教徒便借此举办各种狂欢活动，挑战天主教的权威。久而久之，carnival倒成了一个盛大节日，而封斋节却逐渐被人遗忘。荷兰画家Pieter Bruegel的名画《狂欢者与斋戒者的斗争》（Fight Between Carnival an Lent）便反映了两教派之间的斗争。\ncarnival的前半部分是词根carn，表示“肉”。该词根衍生众多与“肉”有关的单词。\ncarnal：['kɑːn(ə)l] adj.肉体的，性欲的\ncarnival：['kɑːnɪv(ə)l] n.狂欢节，嘉年华，饮宴狂欢\ncarnivore： ['kɑːnɪvɔː] n.食肉动物，食虫植物。记：carni肉+vore吃\ncarnivorous：[kɑː'nɪv(ə)rəs] adj.食肉的，肉食性的\ncarcass： ['kɑrkəs] n.（人或动物的）尸体，残骸；（除脏去头备食用的）畜体\nreincarnate： [,riːɪn'kɑːneɪt] vt.使转世化身adj.转世化身的。记：re再次+in进入+carn肉体+ate动词后缀"},{"t":"carnival:嘉年华","d":"来自拉丁短语carne

parchment'，古法语作volum，英语volume即由此而来，它始见于14世纪，原词形亦作volum。\n后来书的式样变了，但很多纸页订成的厚本书仍称volume，小册子就不叫volume。由于volume所指的是篇幅大、页数多的大部头书，16世纪时又被用以指书的size（篇幅，部头），到17世纪开始泛指各种物体的size，即“量”、“额”、“分量”、“容量”等，而“音量”这一今义则是到19世纪初才出现的。因此，由volume派生出的形容词voluminous便被赋予“篇幅长的”、“大部头的”、“容量大的”等义。\n在探究volume的来龙去脉时，我们发现汉语“卷”的字源与其颇为相似。中国古时的书籍是写在帛或纸上，卷起来收藏，因此书籍的数量论卷，一部书可以分成若干卷。英语的volume何尝不是如此呢？如今volume一词通常也指“（一套书的）卷”或“册”。"},{"t":"volume:体积，容积，卷，册","d":"来自拉丁语

Jerome）在将《新约》从希腊语翻译为拉丁语。在翻译希腊版《新约》中的agape（爱）一词时，他没有将其翻译为拉丁语中常用来表示“爱”的amor，因为amor表达的是“世俗情爱”，而无法表达出上帝对人类、基督徒对同胞的爱。因此，他最后选择了拉丁语caritatem一词，意思是“珍惜、重视、钟爱”。\n 英语单词charity就源自拉丁语caritatem。由于《新约》的影响，该词含有浓厚的宗教色彩，表示上帝对人类、基督徒对同胞的爱，与性无关的爱，可译为“博爱”。基督徒在举行各种募捐慈善活动时，通常以此为由。因此，charity又衍生出“慈善、施舍”之意。\n 衍生词：charitable（仁慈的、博爱的）"},{"t":"charity:慈善","d":"来自PIE*karo,

or at the table of another（在他人的饭桌上吃喝）。古罗马人借用了这个同，在拉丁语作parasittus。16世纪英语通过法语把该词吸收过来，作parasite，但仍保留了它的原义。可见，parasite的原始词义为“食客”，同义于hanger-on。18世纪以后，parasite开始被生物学家用来指“寄生生物”或“寄生植物”，随后又被进而引申用来喻指“依赖他人生活的人”即“寄生虫”。例如：Don't be a parasite，earn your way in life.（别当寄生虫，要自食其力。）原希腊词中sitos这一成分也进入了英语，但被作为一个组合语素，拼作sito-，常见于一些英语科技术语，并还保留着它的原义“食物”，如sitology（饮食学），sitomania（贪食症），sitophobia（畏食）等。"},{"t":"parasite:寄生虫","d":"来自希腊语parasitos,坐在别人旁边吃饭的，吃剩饭的，来自para-,在旁，在周围，sitos,食物，词源同sitophobia.引申词义寄生虫。"}]},{"id":17479,"word":"identical","phonetic0":"aɪˈdentɪk(ə)l","phonetic1":"aɪˈdentɪk(ə)l","trans":[{"pos":"adj.","cn":"完全相同的；同一的；（双胞胎）同卵的；恒等的"}],"sentences":[{"c":"The

\n主人回家后，仆人们向他汇报成就。拿了5塔兰特币和2塔兰特币的仆人，他们的塔兰特币都翻倍了，只有拿了1塔兰特币的仆人依然是1塔兰特币。前两个仆人都得到了主人的夸奖，第三个仆人被主人臭骂一顿，然后把他的1塔兰特夺走，交给第一个仆人。\n \n经济学中有名的“马太效应”就源自这则寓言，在圣经中表达为“凡有的，还要加给他叫他多余；没有的，连他所有的也要夺过来。”意思是强者愈强，弱者愈弱，赢者通吃。\n \n在寓言中，塔兰特币比喻上帝给予每个人的天资。耶稣借这则寓言，告诫人们要好好利用上帝赐予每个人的天资。虽然每个人的天资有高有低，但只要你利用得当，都能得到上帝的赏识，为你提供更多的机遇。所以，本来作为货币单位的英语单词talent也就有了“天资”的含义。\n \ntalent：['tælənt] n.才能，天资，天才"},{"t":"talent:才能，才干，天赋","d":"talent 一词已有数百年的历史，它源自希腊语talanton 'unit of weight or money' （重量或倾货币单位）。英国神学家威克里夫（John Wycliffe,1330 ? -1384）在1382年的《圣经》英译本中就用talent 一词来翻译这一古希腊货币单位。因此在14世纪时talent 原指货币单位，可译为“塔兰特”。1个talent的值究竟有多少往往因时因地而异。据考古学家会计在古希腊1个 talent 约折合现代希腊货币6000德拉克马（drachma）。翻开《圣经.马太福音》我们可以在第25章第14至30节中读到这一则寓言：有个人在出门时把金钱托付给三个仆佣。他按他们各自能力的大小交给他们不同数量的钱，给其中一个5 talents,另一个2 talents,第三个 1 talent。\n  当主人回来时，头两个仆人的钱比主人交给他们时多了一倍，分别为10 talents 和 4 talents ,因而得到主人的奖赏。第三个仆人的钱不增加也没有减少，仍然是 1 talent,因为主人走后他生怕丢失而把钱埋起来。主人本以为他会利用给他的钱去做生意，至少也会把他的 1 talent 存入银行，获得一些利息。为此主人非常生气，严责之余还把那 1 talent 的钱收回并把它交给那个已经有10 talents 的仆人。马太讲的这则小故事的寓意在于教育世人，上帝赋予的天赋和才能人人都有义务去加以发挥。据此，talent 到了15世纪初便由货币单位逐渐转义为“才能”或“天赋”。"},{"t":"talent:天才，天资，天赋","d":"来自拉丁语 talentum,重量，一定数目的钱，来自希腊语 talanton,称量，一定的重量，一定数 目的钱，来自 PIE*tele,举起，称重，词源同 extol,tolerate.据考证，1 talent 为 6000 古希腊货 币 drachma,在当时为一大笔钱。现词义来自圣经的一则寓言，讲得是主人要出远门，按能力 给了三个奴隶一个 5 talenta,一个 2 talenta,一个 1talent,很久以后主人回来了，前两个奴隶用钱 投资钱生钱，最后一个奴隶把钱埋在地底下，主人生气的说，即使你不会投资，你把钱存入 银行至少也有利息啊，我要没收你的钱，把钱交给有能力的人。后引申词义天才，天资等。"}]},{"id":20188,"word":"law
